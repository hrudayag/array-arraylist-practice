# Array & ArrayList Practice (Java)

This repository contains my practice work to understand the internal working of `ArrayList` and the differences between arrays and ArrayList in Java.

## Objective

* Understand how `ArrayList` works internally (dynamic resizing, internal array structure, time complexity).
* Practice converting:

  * Array → ArrayList
  * ArrayList → Array
* Solve problems using both arrays and ArrayList.

## Concepts Covered

* Internal structure of ArrayList
* Capacity growth and resizing mechanism
* Time complexity of common operations
* Conversion between arrays and ArrayList
* Comparison of array vs ArrayList

## Programs Implemented

1. **Second Largest Element (Using Array)**

   * Implemented logic using a normal fixed-size array.
   * Single loop solution with O(n) time complexity.

2. **Remove Duplicates (Using ArrayList)**

   * Converted array to ArrayList.
   * Removed duplicate elements using list operations.
   * Converted result back to array.
